# RainGuard-proj

In this project I created a live chat application for users that want to communicate with one another over the app. All thhe users need to do is to specify the port on which they wish to cummunicate with each other, and the they are redirected to a designated chat room.

This app uses SocketIO in order to maintain the live chat application for app communication.

## Important note

I added the .env files to this project so it is available online for this project. In an actual app going for production, the .env files would have been added to the gitignore file, so it is not available online.

### Important:

Start with running backend first before running the client!
Also, this app is still just running in production mode at the moment.
